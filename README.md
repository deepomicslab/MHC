### Disassortative mating Regions:

### For All: ('disassortative_1_all_find_region' folder)

##### The following steps are used to get complementary regions for 'All'.

- ***find_region_p1.ipynb***:
  Obtain disassortative mating regions for 'All' according to threshold.

- ***find_region_p2.ipynb***:

  Obtain disassortative mating regions for different races according to threshold.

### For Race :('disassortative_2_race_find_region' folder)

##### The following steps are used to get complementary regions for different races.

- ***get_P_race.py***: This file is used to get the probability from the formula

  input: vcf files

  output: csv files with probability

- ***get_position_race.ipynb***

  Get disassortative mating regions for different race, whose method is the same as 'All'.
